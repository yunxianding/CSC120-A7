Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It makes programming so much easier. We don't have to rewrite the same attributes and methods again and again. We can simply just extend the initial class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Library was the hardest one for me personally and I spent quite a lot time on the Hashtable. Luckily I figured it out! I would suggest people to do assignments weekly and don't procrastinate because it will affect your progress for the next week's assignment(especially A7 and A8!)
